# todolist
An attempt at using mySQL with node.js 
This was originally an assignment from the Odin Project to create a ToDo list using
local storage. I felt, though,  that a truly good list that I could use personally  
would require a database. I started out mimicing Microsoft's ToDo and found out how
bad that app actually is. I kept some features and changed others to suit what I felt
was more useful.
